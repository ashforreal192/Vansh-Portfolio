                            As an Electrical and Electronics Engineer specializing in electric vehicles (EVs) and automation,
                            I have cultivated a robust foundation in embedded systems, Battery Management Systems (BMS), motor controllers,
                            and powertrains. My professional journey includes significant contributions at Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd,
                            focusing on EV architecture and data analytics, and at JBM Auto Ltd, where I researched advanced battery systems and lightweight materials. At Strategi Automation Pvt Ltd, I enhanced packaging machine efficiency through PLC programming. My technical repertoire extends to circuit design, PCB assembly, and software integration, complemented by proficiency in Python, MATLAB, and AutoCAD. An innovator at heart, I developed the Bomb Response and Defusal Robot (B.R.D.R.), an IED-defusal prototype with a 45-minute operational endurance, and have undertaken various DIY electronics projects. Beyond engineering, I am an avid gamer with high ranks in titles like Rainbow Six Siege and Counter-Strike, and a fitness enthusiast who has trekked to the Siachen Base Camp and engages in heavy-weight lifting, football, and lawn tennis. My leadership roles include organizing technical events such as ROBOFEST and cultural fests like ATELIER and ACM MUJ Fest. A devoted metalhead, I follow bands like SLAYER and BLOODYWOOD,
                            and having explored Japan's rich culture and technology scene, I eagerly anticipate future travels across Europe and the Nordic regions.
